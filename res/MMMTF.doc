MultiMarkets Multi-TimeFrame Engine

Requires TradeStation RadarScreen Feature: Provides capability for viewing multiple time frame (Monthly, Weekly, Daily, Intraday) information about the same symbol on one RadarScreen row or one chart. Uses the TradeStation Global Dictionary to collect and broadcast data from a special "engine" RadarScreen indicator which then can be read and display from other RadarScreens or charts. Come with sample indicator so you can start build your own multi time frame indicators today. 


The Multi-TimeFrame Engine for TradeStation consists of:

   Four functions: a set/get pair for numbers, and a set/get pair for strings. 
	
   A engine (set side) RadarScreen, with multiple row for each symbol set to different time frames.

   The set side version of the indicator, which collects, calculates and sets the data in the global dictionary. 

   Any number of display (get side) RadarScreens and/or charts (depending on the type of indicator), 

   The get side version of the indicator, which gets and displays the data which was stored on the set side. 

The four functions make it very easy to organize your data in the global dictionary and retrieve it from any 
RadarScreen or chart on the platform. 

Select a unique string for IDStr to identify your indicator's data. 
This will be used on both the engine (set) and display (get) side.
You can define several different ID strings in one indicator if needed.  


The engine (set) side automatically knows the Symbol, BarType (period) and BarInterval (ticks, minutes) based on the RadarScreen row.
To set (store) a number on the engine side: 
		
   IF SET SIDE
   {	
      RC = $MM_MTFSetNum(IDStr, Color);
   }

!SETTING DATA SHOULD ONLY BE DONE AT LastBarOnChart! 


Place your set indicator in a RadarScreen with the time periods you want to track. Keep this in a workspace all its own. The data it generates will be accesible across the platform. 


Place your display (get side) indicator in the appropriate RadarScreens or charts. The get side can get on any bar, not just LastBarOnChart. 

The get side automatically knows the symbol based on the RadarScreen row or chart it is in, 
but you must specify the BarType and BarInterval you want to retrieve. 
In this case it is getting the monthly data. 

   IF GET SIDE 
   {
      Color = $MM_MTFGetNum(IDStr, 4, 0);	
   }

   Bartype:
   4 = Monthly 
   3 = Weekly 
   2 = Daily 
   1 = Minute
   0 = Tick or Volume
   14 = Seconds

   BarInterval is the number of minutes, seconds, ticks, or volume. Use 0 for monthly, weekly and daily. 

Note that Tradestation has a quirk in that BarType is the same for tick and volume charts. 
So the MTF will not be able to differentiate if you have both, for example, 
a 1000-tick row and a 1000-share row on the same symbol.

Set and get string data in the same manner using the string functions: 

   RC   = $MM_MTFSetStr(IDStr, Name); 

   Name = $MM_MTFGetNum(IDStr, 4, 0);	


See the $MMSampleGlobals sample indicator and the MM_MTFSample.tsw workspace for more information on how to write an MTF indicator. 

When you receive the MFT indicator package. If the $MMSamplesGlobal Indicator included is protected, that is you can't see the source code, simply delete it and recreate it using the $MMSampleGlobals.eit file. Then you can follow the code in it to learn how to create your own multi-time frame indicators.
